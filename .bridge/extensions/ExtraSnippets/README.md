# Extra Snippets

### A Snippets extension for the add-on creator brige

This adds many snippets for your add-ons. Some of the snippets are basic components that are common to entitys, blocks, and items, some are different methods of changing properties like disabling damage on entities.

> ⚠️ **<font color="red">Warning:</font>** Intellisense will not show snippets unless there is a comma after the last component like this:

```json
{
   "components": {
   "minecraft:attack": {
    "damage": 5
   }, <--
   Snippet Intellisense activates here
  }
}
```
